# Webcam

First of all, you have to set environment variables in a .env file. Follow the .env-sample template in your completion.
You'll find 'MATTERMOST_URL' & 'CHANNEL_ID' on mattermost. The 'AUTH_TOKEN' have to be given by a mattermost admin.
The mattermost bot who'll send the messages have to be in the channel you completed below to perform the requests.

Then, run the project. All your HTTP-call mistakes will be followed by a beautiful picture of you and all your instant 
sadness. Enjoy :)
